            My B.S. in mechanical engineering from the University of Vermont
            lends me a solid foundation in problem-solving and technical
            communication. As a self-taught programmer I lean on my engineering
            background, eye for detail, and open mind to solve intricate
            problems and design enterprise-scale systems.

            I grew up in Vermont- surrounded by mountains, forests, and the best
            rivers on the face of the earth. That kind of setting makes you
            appreciate the planet early on, and paired with the wisdom of some
            people that I look up to, it sparked a passion for renewable energy

              helped me bridge the gap between mechanical engineering and
              strong, maintainable software systems. Now, I'm doing work that I

            When I'm not in VSCode, I'm usually experimenting in the kitchen,
            playing guitar, shooting a round of disc golf, or spending time with
            the people I love. Maybe I'm even listening to some music! Return to
